# Shwapno Manual Test Cases

## Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive set of manual test cases for the Shwapno project. Shwapno is an online grocery delivery platform that allows users to order groceries and have them delivered to their doorstep. The test cases cover various functionalities and scenarios of the Shwapno application to ensure it is thoroughly tested and meets the desired quality standards.

The project has the following testing types present:

- **User Interface Testing**: User Interface (UI) testing is a type of software testing that focuses on evaluating the graphical user interface of an application. It involves verifying the appearance, functionality, and usability of the user interface elements to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Functional Testing**: Functional testing is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying the functional requirements and specifications of an application. It involves testing the individual functions and features of the software to ensure that they work as intended and meet the desired functionality.

- **Non-Functional Testing**: Non-functional testing is a type of software testing that focuses on evaluating the attributes of a system that are not directly related to its functionality. It assesses the performance, reliability, security, and other non-functional aspects of the software application.

- **Usability Testing**: Usability testing is a type of software testing that focuses on evaluating the ease of use and user-friendliness of an application. It involves gathering feedback from real users to assess how well the application meets their needs, how easily they can navigate through it, and how intuitively they can perform tasks.

This project also include:

- **Test Plan**: A test plan in a test case project provides an overall strategy and approach for testing a specific software application or system. It outlines the objectives, scope, and resources required for testing and serves as a guide for the entire testing process.
- **Mind Maps**: Mind maps in a test case project are graphical representations that help organize and visualize the various components, dependencies, and relationships within the testing process. They provide a visual overview of the test cases, test scenarios, and their interconnections.
- **Test Cases**: A test case in a test case project is a detailed set of instructions and conditions that define how a specific aspect or functionality of a software application should be tested. It outlines the steps to be executed, the expected results, and any preconditions or prerequisites required for the test execution.
- **Bug Report**: A bug report in a test case project is a formal document that describes an identified issue or defect in the software application. It provides detailed information about the problem, including the steps to reproduce it, the observed behavior, and any supporting documentation or evidence.
- **Summary Report**: A summary report in a test case project is a high-level document that provides an overview of the testing activities and results. It summarizes the key findings, metrics, and observations from the testing effort.
- **Test Metrics**: Test metrics in a test case project are quantitative measurements that provide insights into the effectiveness and progress of the testing effort. They help assess the quality of the software application and provide valuable data for decision-making and process improvement.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

**Test Case Documentation**: This folder contains the detailed documentation of the test cases. Each test case is documented separately, providing clear instructions, expected results, and any prerequisites or preconditions required for execution.

**Test Case Execution Logs**: This folder includes logs or reports generated during the execution of the test cases. It provides a record of the test execution process, including any issues encountered and their resolutions.

**Test Data**: This folder contains the sample test data used in the test cases. It may include data files, spreadsheets, or any other relevant resources required for executing the test cases accurately.

**Test Environment Setup**: This section provides instructions for setting up the test environment, including the hardware, software, and configuration requirements necessary for executing the test cases.

**Test Case Management**: This section outlines the approach and tools used for managing and tracking the test cases. It may include information about the test management system, issue tracking system, or any other relevant tools employed for test case management.

## Test Case Structure

Each test case is organized into the following sections:

- **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for the test case.
  
- **Test Objective**: A brief description of the objective or purpose of the test case.
  
- **Preconditions**: Any necessary prerequisites or conditions that must be met before executing the test case.
  
- **Test Steps**: Detailed step-by-step instructions on how to execute the test case.
  
- **Expected Results**: The expected outcome or behavior of the Pickaboo application after executing the test steps.
  
- **Test Data**: Any specific test data or inputs required for executing the test case.
  
- **Test Environment**: The hardware, software, and configuration requirements for executing the test case.
  
- **Test Status**: The current status of the test case (e.g., Pass, Fail, In Progress).
